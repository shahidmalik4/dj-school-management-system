# School Management System

Welcome to the School Management System! This web application is designed to streamline various administrative tasks within a school environment, including managing students, staff, courses, attendance, and performance tracking.

üöÄ **Introduction:**
The School Management System is a web-based application developed using Python, Django for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides authentication for administrators, staff, and students, each with different roles and privileges. The system offers features such as managing student and staff profiles, attendance tracking, course management, leave applications, and performance analysis.

üí° **What I Learned:**
Through developing this project, I gained valuable experience in full-stack web development using Python and Django for backend logic and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for creating an intuitive and responsive user interface. I also learned about user authentication, role-based access control, database management, and integrating frontend with backend functionalities.
